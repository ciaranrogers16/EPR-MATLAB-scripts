# Modelling conformational flexibility in a spectrally addressable multi-spin molecular qubit (JACS doi./)

1) Raw Data<br />
   EDFS, Relaxation, DEER, RIDME data<br />

2) Make p-vector code 
   Three spin cone geometric cone model 
   P-vector libraries

3) oriDEERsim code
   Simulation of orientation dependent dipolar interaction using a modified version of the code reported by Lovett et al. 

4) Data processing scripts  
   Raw dipolar data processing for plotting of final figures in main text

5) Least squares fitting routine 
   Calculation and plotting of best fitting p-vectors to the time domain data

6) Plotting to chimera
   Script to take best fitting p-vectors for visualisation in chimera
