# Data and MATLAB scripts for *JACS* doi/10.1021/jacs.xxxxxxx.

## 1) Raw Data 
- This folder contains .DSC and .DTA files of the raw EPR data. <br /> 
## 2) P-vector <br />
- This folder contains the code used to build the libraries of p-vectors describing the interactions in a three spin system. <br />
## 3) Orientation dependent simulation <br />
- This folder contains a modified version of the orientation dependent algorithm used to simulate dipolar spectra, originally reported by Lovett et al. <br />
## 4) Least squares fitting <br />
- This folder contains the code for the least squares fitting routine used to identify the best fitting simulated data sets to the experimental data. <br />
## 5) Data processing <br />
- This folder contains the scripts used in the processing of the experimental and simulated EPR data. <br />
## 6) Plotting and visualisation <br />
- This folder contains the scripts used to plot the EPR data and make .PDB and .BILD files for visualisation of data in Chimera
