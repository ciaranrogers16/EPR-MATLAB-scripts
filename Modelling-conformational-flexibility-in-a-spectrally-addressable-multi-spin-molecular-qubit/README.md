# Data and MATLAB scripts for *doi/*

## Raw Data 
- This folder contains .DSC and .DTA files of the raw EPR data. <br /> 
## P-vector <br />
- This folder contains the code used to build the libraries of p-vectors describing the interactions in the three spin system. <br />
## Orientation dependent simulation <br />
- This folder contains a modified version of the orientation dependent algorithm used to simulate dipolar spectra, originally reported by Lovett et al. *doi.org/10.1039/b907010a* <br />
## Least squares fitting <br />
- This folder contains the code for the least squares fitting routine used to identify the best fitting simulated data sets to the experimental data. <br />
##  Data processing <br />
- This folder contains the scripts used in the processing of the experimental and simulated EPR data. <br />
##  Plotting and visualisation <br />
- This folder contains the scripts used to plot to make .pdb and .bild files for visualisation of dipolar data in Chimera
